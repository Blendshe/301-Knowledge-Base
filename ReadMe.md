### Reactjs   

The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook.  Reactjs is the most popular of programming lnguages at the moment.  It's called React because it reacts to changes and updates the state.  It's a library that only renders the view for UI. 

React build user interfaces and applications quickly and efficiently using less code than you would with JavaScript.   

In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent building blocks, like using Lego! These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, create the whole user interface.  There is a virtual DOM and the real DOM which React updates 

Twitter is an example of creating seperate componets for a whole UI interface.
