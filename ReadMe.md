## Class 01 - React

### Overview  
  
<p>The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. Reactjs is the most popular of programming lnguages at the moment. It's called React because it reacts to changes and updates the state. It's a library that only renders the view for UI.</p>  

React builds user interfaces and applications quickly and efficiently using less code than you would with JavaScript.  
  
In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent building blocks, like using Lego! These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, create the whole user interface. There is a virtual DOM and the real DOM which React updates  
  
Twitter is an example of creating seperate componets for a whole UI interface.

### My notes   
  
React uses component based architecture - there are different types of architecture: header, footer, side and these are components.  
There will be other components depending on what you are building  

For every component there are 4 characteristics, these are:  
  
1. Imports  
2. Styles - this is CSS  
3. Functions - this is js  
4. Exports  
  
Component based architecutre has points that make is good to use:

1. consistency  
2. efficiency  
3. data - only working with data in a single component at a time  
4. easy to debug (see 3. above)  
5. reusable - write is once, use again  
6. replaceable - do not need to change the whole page, just the comonent  
7. maintainable  
8. reliable  
9. independent - if there is a problem only one component is affected
