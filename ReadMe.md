## Class 01 - React
  
React uses component based architecture - there are different types of architecture: header, footer, side and these are components.  
There will be other components depending on what you are building  

For every component there are 4 characteristics, these are:  
  
1. Imports  
2. Styles - this is CSS  
3. Functions - this is js  
4. Exports  
  
Component based architecutre has points that make is good to use:

1. consistency  
2. efficiency  
3. data - only working with data in a single component at a time  
4. easy to debug (see 3. above)  
5. reusable - write is once, use again  
6. replaceable - do not need to change the whole page, just the comonent  
7. maintainable  
8. reliable  
9. independent - if there is a problem only one component is affected
